    "details2": "As soon as you do not respond to the Life Certificate, our team of expert inheritance lawyers will immediately contact the main beneficiary that you have indicated in the application. Both by email and by phone , we will insist until we get an answer. Once located, we will send you all the information about your digital assets. There will be no robots, no chats, no cold and inhumane automations that can fail. Just a friendly voice on the other end of the phone." ,

    "title3": "Safe technology with a head",
    "details3": "Almost no technology is free from hacking. Tell Zuckerberg or NASA. Therefore, in addition to applying an encryption system in Leggado.Digital and an extra layer of security with IP restrictions, we also use the head. When registering the catalog of assets, passwords and access keys are not included, only their physical location. In this way, we keep the door away from the key that opens it."
