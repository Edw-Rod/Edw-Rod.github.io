It's something that happens to the schoolmate you haven't seen for centuries, the neighbor from the fifth or the supermarket cashier, but to you... never, ever, impossible. Yeah, sure. The cemetery is full of clueless unbelievers. Yes indeed. On their tombstones, all that remains is to put: they left for the other neighborhood in peace, but they left a big brown to their family",

What's more, you don't have to die. With you staying to put sugar on the cakes, that's enough."
